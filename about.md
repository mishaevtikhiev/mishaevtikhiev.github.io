#### Physics
Hi, I am Mikhail (Misha) Evtikhiev. I am doing PhD in high energy theoretical physics at [Weizmann Institute of Science](http://weizmann.ac.il) under the guidance of Prof. Ofer Aharony. My research is mainly focused on the properties of supersymmetric conformal theories in 4 dimensions, you can find my publication list [on Spires](http://inspirehep.net/search?ln=en&p=find+a+mikhail+evtikhiev&of=hb&action_search=Search&sf=earliestdate&so=d).

#### Life
When not doing research, I enjoy reading fiction, sightseeing old European cities and various natural attractions, playing soccer and badminton.  
I am fascinated by real-life data sets, I believe that they hide many stories no one cares to tell; the English part of my blog is mostly dedicated to the funny results I managed to wring out of them. I also occasionally blog in Russian about the topics that won't interest international reader.
