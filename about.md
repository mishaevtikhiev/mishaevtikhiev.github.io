#### Physics
Hi, I am Mikhail (Misha) Evtikhiev. I am doing PhD in high energy theoretical physics at [Weizmann Institute of Science](http://weizmann.ac.il) under the guidance of Prof. Ofer Aharony. My research is mainly focused on the properties of supersymmetric conformal theories in 4 dimensions, you can find my publication list [on Spires](http://inspirehep.net/search?ln=en&p=find+a+mikhail+evtikhiev&of=hb&action_search=Search&sf=earliestdate&so=d) and my CV [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/CV.pdf). 

#### Life
When not doing research, I enjoy reading fiction, sightseeing old European cities and various natural attractions, playing soccer and badminton.  
I blog in English about issues that bother me and can be quantified. I also blog in Russian on the topics that won't interest international reader.
